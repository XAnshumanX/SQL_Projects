### üçΩÔ∏è Zomato Case Study ‚Äì PostgreSQL Project 

This project is a **Product Dissection of Zomato** focusing on how its data model supports restaurant discovery, food ordering, delivery, and reviews.
It includes **PostgreSQL schema design, sample data, and queries** for insights.

##  Queries

### 1. Top 5 Most-Ordered Restaurants

```sql
SELECT r.Name AS Restaurant, COUNT(o.OrderID) AS Total_Orders
FROM Orders o
JOIN Restaurants r ON o.RestaurantID = r.RestaurantID
WHERE o.Order_Status = 'Delivered'
GROUP BY r.Name
ORDER BY Total_Orders DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 2. Average Delivery Partner Ratings

```sql
SELECT Partner_Name, ROUND(AVG(Partner_Rating),2) AS Avg_Rating
FROM Partners
GROUP BY Partner_Name;
```

### 3. Customer Order Frequency Analysis

```sql
SELECT u.Full_Name, COUNT(o.OrderID) AS Order_Count
FROM Users u
JOIN Orders o ON u.UserID = o.UserID
WHERE o.Order_Status = 'Delivered'
GROUP BY u.Full_Name
ORDER BY Order_Count DESC;
```
